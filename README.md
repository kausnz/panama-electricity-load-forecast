# Panama Electricity Load Forecast

This is a mid-term project for ML Zoomcamp 2022.

Guidelines:
1. [ ] Think of a problem that's interesting for you and find a dataset for that
2. [ ] Describe this problem and explain how a model could be used
3. [ ] Prepare the data and doing EDA, analyze important features
4. [ ] Train multiple models, tune their performance and select the best model
5. [ ] Export the notebook into a script
6. [ ] Put your model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker
7. [ ] Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud

## System requirements to run locally
This notebook was developed on macOS platform. Pipenv is used to isolate the python version and dependencies, and they can be found in the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. You can initialise the python environment by running `pipenv install --system --deploy`.

## Makefile
All the shell commands are collated into a Makefile for convenience. See the Makefile in this directory.

## Having trouble?
If you run into any issues when viewing the notebook or running the project locally, please reach out to me via MLZoomcamp Slack (user @Kaush S.).
